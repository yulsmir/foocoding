// Task 10. Write a program to answer the following questions:
// 10.1 Can you store multiple types in an array? Numbers and strings? Make an example that illustrates your answer. 
// 10.2 Can you compare infinities? (Not in Eyad's world) - does 6/0 === 10/0? How can you test this?
// 10.3 Add console.log statements to the above program in which you show that you understand the concepts (just like you've done in the above assignments).
