# Node.js HTTP Server

This repository shows how to create a Node.js HTTP from Scrath, implementing basic routing but trying to get the necessary functionality to show how this type of application works under the hood.

## Requirements:

Node.js 18.16.x or greater.

## Running the server

To run the application in production mode you can use the next command:

```bash

```

To run the application in development mode you can use the next command:

```

Note: The application in development mode use the Node.js native watch feature to reload the application after file changes.
